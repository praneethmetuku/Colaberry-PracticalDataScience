    "Stored procedures, triggers and materialized views are some of the advanced SQL concepts. A stored procedure is a set of instructions/SQL queries which performs a logical action on the database server and is executed on a recurring basis, much like a standard operating procedure. A trigger is a type of stored procedure, which is set to automatically execute when a certain event occurs in the database (Eg. Say a record in a specific table is updated or deleted). A view is the output of a sql query which is presented in the console, but not stored on disk. When this output is stored on disk, in the form of a structure, in order to retrieve it frequently (instead of having to run the query again), it is called a materialized view.\n",
