However, this module does not offer the complete querying capability of a typical SQL engine and functions as a light-weight API version of the querying engine.

It covers using SQL as a data storage and query system, assuming you already have datasets in CSV format that you would like to query and analyze.\n",

First is just the principle of having data organized into tables of a single purpose. But more importantly is to reduce duplication of data. If you had demographic data in the grades table, it would duplicate all the demographic data for every course a student takes, which makes it harder to change, and introduces consistency issues if the data doesn't match in every row. It's better to have one authorative source for data and let the database worry about joining and cross referencing when necessary.\n",
