Many of them predicted that a machine as intelligent as a human being would exist in no more than a generation and they were given millions of dollars to make this vision come true [1]. AI is now used to describe algorithms or mathematical techniques that can imitate intelligence involving activities such as learning, inference, predictions and decision making."
